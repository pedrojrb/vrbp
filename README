# üè¢ Virtual Room Booking Platform (VRBP)  

A backend system for managing virtual room reservations efficiently and securely. Users can create, update, and cancel bookings while checking room availability in real-time. Built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **Sequelize ORM** for SQL database integration.  


## üöÄ Features  
- User management (authentication and role-based access).  
- Room availability checks and efficient booking management.  
- SQL database integration using **Sequelize ORM**.  
- Secure data validation and input sanitization.  
- Scalable and modular backend architecture.  
- Logging and error handling.  
  
## üõ† Tech Stack  
- **Node.js** - Backend runtime  
- **Express.js** - Web framework  
- **Sequelize ORM** - Database management  
- **SQL Database** (PostgreSQL/MySQL)  
- **dotenv** - Environment variable management  
- **Mocha & Chai** - Testing framework  

## üõ†Ô∏è Design and Practices

### **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Encapsulation:** Controllers manage logic independently for rooms, users, and reservations.
- **Inheritance:** Middleware and service classes share reusable logic.
- **Polymorphism:** Service functions handle dynamic data types for different database operations.

### **Database Connection and Management**
- Using **Sequelize ORM** for database abstraction and model relationships.
- Migrations for version control of the database schema.
- Optimized SQL queries for efficient data retrieval and conflict resolution.

### **Design Patterns**
- **Composite Pattern:** Used for managing hierarchical data structures, such as nested reservation rules or combined room properties.
- **Iterator Pattern:** Applied in services to iterate through reservation lists or user collections efficiently.

### **Security Practices**
- Input validation and sanitization.
- JWT-based authentication.
- Protection against SQL injection and common vulnerabilities.
